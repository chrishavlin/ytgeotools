    ignore:The register_cmap function will be deprecated in a future version. Use ``matplotlib.colormaps.register(name)`` instead.:PendingDeprecationWarning
    ignore:`np.float` is a deprecated alias for the builtin `float`. To silence this warning, use `float` by itself. Doing this will not modify any behavior and is safe. If you specifically wanted the numpy scalar type, use `np.float64` here.:DeprecationWarning:tslearn.*
    ignore:`np.int` is a deprecated alias for the builtin `int`. To silence this warning, use `int` by itself. Doing this will not modify any behavior and is safe. When replacing `np.int`, you may wish to use e.g. `np.int64` or `np.int32` to specify the precision. If you wish to review your current use, check the release note link for additional information.:DeprecationWarning:tslearn.*
